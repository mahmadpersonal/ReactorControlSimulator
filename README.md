# ReactorControlSimulator
A simple reactor control program that allows users to toggle the status of 10 reactors. It displays the status of each reactor and allows users to manage their on/off state interactively.

**ReactorControlSimulator**
This project is a simple console-based reactor control system written in C++. It simulates the operation of 10 reactors, allowing users to toggle their on/off statuses. The program provides an interactive interface where users can:

Enter a reactor number (1-10) to toggle its status.
Turn the reactor on or off by pressing 1 (on) or 0 (off).
View the status of all reactors at any point.
Exit or continue the program based on user input.
The status of each reactor is represented by a character (+ for on, - for off), and users can check the current state of all reactors at any time.
